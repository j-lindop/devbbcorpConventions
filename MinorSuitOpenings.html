<h2 class="articleSubHeading">Three-card Minors?</h2>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">What would you
open with this
hand?</p>

<p class="customParagraphStyle">If the answer
is 1x, then you are
playing the popular North American
style of five-card majors where you
open the longer minor with no fivecard major.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">The 1x opening is a natural, non
forcing bid. Partner could pass with
fewer than 6 points, even when short
in diamonds. </p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">A 1w or 1x opening is more likely to be made on a four, five, or sixcard suit than a three-card suit.
Partner, however, is aware that it can
occasionally be made on as few as
three cards and this is indicated by
marking the convention card like this: </p>

<h2 class="articleSubHeading">What Are The Other Choices?</h2>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">If the partnership plays four-card
major suit openings, it could check
off that both a 1w and 1x opening
promise at least four cards. That’s
unusual, however. Even playing fourcard majors, 1w is sometimes
opened on a three-card suit . . .
when the four-card major is very
weak, for example.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Some partnerships like to
play that a 1x opening bid shows
at least a four-card suit. That
leaves the 1w opening to handle
every hand that doesn’t contain a
five-card major or a four-card
diamond suit. The above hand,
for example, would be opened
1w instead of 1x because there
are only three diamonds. So, 1w
could be opened on two or fewer
cards and this style would be
indicated like this:</p>
<img src="https://devbbcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/oneNTRange.png">
<p class="customParagraphStyle">The NF at the top of the third
column indicates that even though
the 1w opening may be made on
fewer than three cards, it is still non
forcing . . . partner can pass.
Although the column indicates 0-2
cards, the 1w opening would not be
on a void or a singleton unless the
partnership plays some very unusual
methods. Partnerships that use an
artificial 1w opening, however, will
sometimes open a non-forcing 1x
on a singleton or a void.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">n a singleton or a void.
This column is in blue (grey)
indicating that such a bid must be
announced. If your partner opens
1w and it could be on two or fewer
cards, you would say “May be short.”</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">If the partnership uses an approach
in which the 1w opening is totally
artificial and forcing, such as the
Precision Club, then the last column
would be checked. This column is in
red, so such a bid must be alerted.</p>

<h2 class="articleSubHeading">What About The Short Club?</h2>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Some players still refer to their
approach as the “short club,” perhaps putting too much emphasis on
the possibility that 1w may not show
four or more cards. This is fine if
they are really using the standard
style of opening the longer or
“better” minor . . . typically opening
1x with two four-card minors and
1w with two three-card minors. </p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">If, however, they insist that
partner respond to their 1w opening,
even with fewer than 6 points, they
are actually playing a forcing 1w
opening. If that’s the case, they need
to check the red box and be sure to
alert the opponents whenever they
open with 1w. </p>

<h2 class="articleSubHeading">Limit Raises?</h2>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Suppose your partner
opens 1x and this is
your hand. What do
you respond? </p>
<div class="singleHand">
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbol">&spades;</div>
      <div><span class="tens">1</span>0</div>
   </div>
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbolRed">&hearts;</div>
      <div>K<span class="tens">1</span>0</div>
   </div>
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbolRed">&diams;</div>
      <div><span class="tens">1</span>0</div>
   </div>
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbol">&clubs;</div>
      <div><span class="tens">1</span>0</div>
   </div>
</div>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">If the
answer is 3x, showing support and
an invitational hand of about 11-12
points, you are playing limit raises.
You would check the box for Inv.
(invitational) beside Double Raise
under Responses. </p>
<img src="https://devbbcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/oneNTRange.png">
<p class="customParagraphStyle">This is the standard use of the
double raise of opener’s minor
although, for reasons discussed
shortly, some partnerships use this
as a forcing bid or as a weak bid
. . . which would be alertable.</p>

<h2 class="articleSubHeading">What If There Is an Overcall?</h2>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">What if you hold the same hand
opposite partner’s 1x opening bid
but the opponent on your right
makes an overcall of 1z?</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">If you would still jump to 3x to
show an invitational hand, you
would check the Invitational box
beside After Overcall:</p>
<img src="https://devbbcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/oneNTRange.png">
<p class="customParagraphStyle">The modern trend is to treat a
jump raise as preemptive (weak)
after an overcall. The overcall has
made two bids available: a double
and a cuebid. Most partnerships use
the double as takeout (negative) and
the cuebid is used to show a limit
raise or better in opener’s minor.
So, with the above hand, you would
cuebid 2z. That frees the jump
response to 3x as a weak bid in
competitive auctions.</p>

<h2 class="articleSubHeading">The Forcing Raise?</h2>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">What if partner
opens 1w and you
hold this hand? </p>
<div class="singleHand">
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbol">&spades;</div>
      <div><span class="tens">1</span>0</div>
   </div>
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbolRed">&hearts;</div>
      <div>K<span class="tens">1</span>0</div>
   </div>
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbolRed">&diams;</div>
      <div><span class="tens">1</span>0</div>
   </div>
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbol">&clubs;</div>
      <div><span class="tens">1</span>0</div>
   </div>
</div>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">You
have support for
clubs and enough to take the partnership to game. A jump to 3w would
only be invitational and you don’t
want to go beyond 3NT because that
might be the best contract.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Over a major suit opening, an
artificial jump to 2NT is often used
to show support for the major and
enough to reach game. Over a minor
suit, notrump responses are usually
treated as natural. On this hand, you
don’t want to respond in notrump
with a low doubleton heart.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Many partnerships skirt this
dilemma by having no forcing raise
over a minor suit. If the hand is
unsuitable for a response in
notrump, then there is usually a side
four-card suit to bid. If not, as in
this hand, a response is made in a
three-card suit. A response of 1x
has the advantage that it is forcing
and little can go wrong. If opener
raises diamonds, you plan to show
the club support and get the partnership to game in clubs or notrump.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">If this is your approach, leave the
lines beside Forcing Raise blank. </p>
<img src="https://devbbcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/oneNTRange.png">
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Some partnerships prefer to have
a way of showing a forcing raise.
One possibility is to use a jump shift
(J/S) in the other minor as artificial
and forcing . . . giving up on the
natural meaning. Using that
approach, you would jump to 2x on
this hand.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Another approach is to use
inverted minor suit raises. In this
style, a raise of opener’s minor to
the two level is forcing for one
round, showing either a limit raise
or a game-going raise. A jump raise
to the three level can then be used as
a weak raise with about 6-9 points.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Using this approach, you would
show the support by simply raising
to 2w. Opener would have to make
a rebid and you would then make
sure the partnership reached game.
You would check the box beside
Single raise to indicate that this is a
forcing raise and you would also put
a check beside Weak in the earlier
section covering the Double Raise.
Since both these bids are in red, you
would have to alert when your partner raises a 1w or 1x opening to the
two or three level.</p>


<h2 class="articleSubHeading">Do You Bypass Diamonds?</h2>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">What do you respond
with this hand if
partner opens 1w?</p>
<div class="singleHand">
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbol">&spades;</div>
      <div><span class="tens">1</span>0</div>
   </div>
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbolRed">&hearts;</div>
      <div>K<span class="tens">1</span>0</div>
   </div>
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbolRed">&diams;</div>
      <div><span class="tens">1</span>0</div>
   </div>
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbol">&clubs;</div>
      <div><span class="tens">1</span>0</div>
   </div>
</div>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">With a choice of suits
to bid at the one level, the basic
approach is to bid the longer suit. Even
with only four diamonds, a response of
1x would be in keeping with bidding
four-card suits “up the line.”</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Many players, however, would
respond 1y. One reason is that the
emphasis over a minor suit opening
is to look for a major suit fit before
settling on notrump or a minor suit.
With a weak hand that is only likely
to make one bid, getting the major
suit in takes priority. Also, if you
were to respond 1x and the next
player overcalls 1z, it might
become difficult to find a heart fit if
you both have four cards in the suit.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">If you do tend to bypass a fourcard or longer diamond suit after
partner opens 1w, check appropriate
box. You don’t have to alert.</p>
<img src="https://devbbcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/oneNTRange.png">


<h2 class="articleSubHeading">Notrump Responses?</h2>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">It used to be popular to use the
response of 1NT over an opening 1w
(1NT/1w) to show about 9-11 points.
With a weaker hand of 6-8 points and
no suit to bid at the one level, you
could raise to 2w. The modern trend,
however, is to use a range of 6-10
points for the 1NT response.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Similarly, a 2NT response classically shows a balanced hand of about
13–15 points, with 3NT showing
16–17 points. A popular modern
style, however, is to use the “limit
bid” approach and treat 2NT as an
invitational response with about 11 or
12 points and 3NT to show a balanced hand of 13–15 points. With 16
or more, start by bidding a new suit.
You would then fill out the last part of
this section like this:</p>
<img src="https://devbbcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/oneNTRange.png">
<p class="customParagraphStyle">And, unless you play any other
fancy conventions over a minor suit,
you’re done.</p>
