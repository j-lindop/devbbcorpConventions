         <p class="customParagraphStyle">At one time, it was common to make a penalty double in this situation. After all, you expect to defeat 1&spades; by several tricks and to collect a large penalty.</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">In today’s game, this approach is rarely used ... at least at low levels. There are two main reasons. First, the situation doesn’t arise often. An opponent typically has length and strength in the overcalled suit. Even if the overcall is made with a poor suit, it may be difficult to collect a large enough penalty to compensate for the score your side would make playing the hand. Second, a double at this point warns the opponents that they are in trouble. They may be able to find a better spot. What if the opponents run to 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>, for example? It’s often better to wait until they have nowhere to go.</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">With this hand, most players would pass. The auction isn’t over. If the opponent on your left passes, partner may double for takeout with shortness in spades. You would pass a second time, converting the double into a penalty double.</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">So, double of a low level overcall can be used for takeout. It’s now so uncommon for a partnership to agree that responder’s double of an overcall is for penalty that you would have to indicate this by hecking the box marked ‘Penalty’:</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">Since this is in red, the double would have to be alerted by opener.</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">One exception is the double of a notrump overcall. This is for penalty in standard practice, so you don’t
            need to indicate this agreement on the convention card.	
         </p>
         <h2 class="headingTwo_article">The Negative Double</h2>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">If the double of an overcall isn’t used for penalty, it can be used for takeout. Suppose your partner opens 1<span class="red">&diams;</span>, the next player overcalls 1&spades;, and this is your hand. It is more likely to be the type of hand you might hold as responder after an overcall.</p>

         <!-- /.singleHand -->
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">You were planning to respond 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span> but the overcall got in the way. You don’t have enough strength to bid a new suit at the two level, you don’t have support for partner, and a bid of 1NT is unattractive with nothing in spades. Still, you have enough to compete for the contract and would like to send this message to partner.</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">Most partnerships use a double by responder to show exactly this type of hand ... enough strength to compete and support for the two unbid suits. This form of takeout double is called a negative (non-penalty) double.</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">If the partnership agrees to use negative doubles after an overcall, there must also be agreement on how high they apply. The standard agreement is through 2&spades;. This means that a double of any suit overcall up to  and including 2&spades; is for takeout. A double of a higher level overcall, such as 3&clubs;, is for penalty. This would be indicated like this:</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">Since this is standard practice, negative doubles do not need to be alerted. Many partnerships prefer a
            higher range for negative doubles, such as through 3&spades;. Mark the appropriate level on the card. However, if you use negative doubles higher than 4&spades;, such doubles are alertable.

         <p class="customParagraphStyle">You are the advancer—partner of the takeout doubler—and have enough to compete for the contract. But which suit should you bid?</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">Partner could have four-card support for both hearts and spades, but there is no guarantee. Partner might have  four-card support for one major but only three-card support for the other. You don’t want to guess wrong and land in a 4–3 fit at the three level.</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">When left-hand-opponent opens, partner doubles, and right-hand opponent raises opener’s suit, a double in standard methods is for penalty. However, many partnerships prefer to use the double for takeout. It is called a responsive double and asks for the takeout doubler’s help in choosing the suit.</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">The partnership has to agree how high responsive doubles apply. For example, the partnership can agree to play them through 3<span class="red">&diams;</span>:</p>

         <p class="customParagraphStyle">With this agreement, South’s double would be for takeout, not penalty</p>

         <p class="customParagraphStyle">Note: a responsive double only applies if responder raises, or jump raises, opener’s suit. If responder bids notrump or a new suit after a takeout double, the standard agreement is that a double is for penalty.</p>
