         <!-- /.singleHand -->
         <p class="customParagraphStyle"> If the answer is 1&clubs;, then you are playing five-card majors, the popular style in North America. An opening bid of 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span> or 1&spades;  promises a five-card or longer suit. With no five-card major suit, you open the longer minor suit.</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">Doesn’t everyone play this way? In places such as England, four-card major suit openings are common. These players would consider it strange to open a weak three-card suit when you have two very fine four-card suits. Even some top North American partnerships prefer four-card majors.</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">However, your partnership is likely with the majority and you would check the box for 5 beside Expected Minimum Length.</p>
         <img src="conventionCardImgs/ExpectedMinLength12.png" class="centerImageDashed" alt="">
         <h3 class="headingThree_article">Why Are There Two Lines?</h2>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">A closer examination shows that there are two lines for the expected minimum length. One is for opening bids in first and second position (1st/2nd) and one is for opening bids in third and fourth position (3rd/4th). Consider this hand.</p>
         <div class="singleHand">

            <div class="singleSuit">

               <div>9743</div>
            </div>
         </div>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">Playing standard five-card majors, this hand would universally be opened 1&clubs;  in first or second position because there is no five-card major. Since partner is unlimited, you may be headed for game or slam and want to be sure to find the best trump suit.</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">If partner passes and you have an opportunity to open in third or fourth chair with a minimum hand, there are tactical considerations. Since partner has fewer than 13 points, your prospects for game . . . and definitely slam . . . are much less. Your side might not even win the auction. If you do end up defending with partner on lead, you’d much prefer that partner lead a spade than a club. Also, an opening bid of 1&spades;  will make it more difficult for the opponents to enter the auction than an opening bid of 1&clubs;. So, opening a strong four-card major in third or fourth position has a lot going for it.</p>

         <h3 class="headingThree_article">Weak</h3>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">The modern style is toward treating a jump raise as preemptive (weak) after an overcall. Why? The opponent’s overcall has made two new bids available: a double and a cuebid. Most partnerships use the double as takeout (negative) but the cuebid can be used to show a limit raise or better in opener’s suit. So, with the above hand, you would cuebid 2&spades; rather than jumping to 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span>. That frees up the 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span> jump response to be a weak bid in competitive auctions, designed to make it difficult for the opponents to find their best spot.</p>

         <p class="customParagraphStyle">Whether your partnership treats the jump raise as invitational, strong (forcing to game), or weak, just check the appropriate box.

         <p class="customParagraphStyle">Most partnerships use some conventional method to describe a forcing (game-going) raise. The most popular method is Jacoby 2NT. A 2NT response to a major suit is artificial, showing four-card or longer support and a hand worth 13 or more points. Opener then has ways to show a minimum hand or extra distribution or strength. If that’s your style, check the box for 2NT beside Conv(entional) Raise.</p>

         </div>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">Some partnerships would respond 4&clubs;  with the above hand, a splinter bid showing support for hearts, shortness in clubs, and enough strength for game. If your partnership also uses this convention, check the appropriate box.</p>
         <img src="conventionCardImgs/majorConvRaiseSplinter.png" class="centerImageDashed" alt="">
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">If you don’t have a conventional forcing raise in response to a major suit, you wouldn’t check any of these boxes. You would probably respond in a new suit with this hand, planning to show the heart support and strength on your rebid.</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">If you would jump to 4<span class="red">&hearts;</span> with this hand, that’s fine.

         <p class="customParagraphStyle">A popular modern trend is toward a two-over-one style where a new suit response at the two level is usually forcing to game. A consequence of this style is that a 1NT response to a major suit is typically played as a forcing response instead of an invitational response . . . or semi-forcing if responder is a passed hand.</p>
         <img src="conventionCardImgs/major1NTSemiForcing.png" class="centerImageDashed" alt="">
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">If your partnership plays a forcing 1NT response, you would check the appropriate box. If your 1NT response is non forcing, showing 6-9 or 10 points, you don’t need to mark anything.</p>
         <h2 class="headingTwo_article">Other Notrump Responses</h2>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">If you use the Jacoby 2NT convention, your 2NT . . . and perhaps 3NT . . . responses are artificial. If you use a more natural style, a 2NT response would typically show an invitational balanced hand of 11-12 points or a game-going balanced hand with 13-15 points. You would then fill in the appropriate ranges for your 2NT and 3NT response (16-17?). Otherwise, leave them blank. This is usually more applicable to responses to a minor suit. Natural responses in notrump don’t need to be alerted.</p>

         <p class="customParagraphStyle">With 11 high-card points you have enough to make a limit raise to 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span> . . . and, if that’s your style, read no further</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">A popular tactic at duplicate bridge, however, is to occasionally open “light” in third or fourth position . . . hoping for a small plus or to get the partnership off to the best opening lead. If partner has opened with 10 or 11 points, a jump to 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span> might get the partnership too high.</p>
         <p class="customParagraphStyle">A popular solution to this dilemma is the Drury convention. A response of 2&clubs;  is artificial and asks if opener has a real opening bid. Originally, a rebid of 1&clubs;  by opener was used to show the “light” hand. The modern trend is to play Reverse Drury, where a rebid of the original suit shows no interest in getting higher. If you play that version, you would respond 2&clubs; with this hand and pass opener’s rebid of 2<span class="red">&hearts;</span>. You would fill out the card like this:</p>
