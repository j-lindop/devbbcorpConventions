<p class="customParagraphStyle"> If the answer is 1w, then you are playing five-card majors, the popular style in North America. An opening bid of 1y or 1z promises a five-card or longer suit. With no five-card major suit, you open the longer minor suit.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Doesn’t everyone play this way? In places such as England, four-card major suit openings are common. These players would consider it strange to open a weak three-card suit when you have two very fine four-card suits. Even some top North American partnerships prefer four-card majors.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">However, your partnership is likely with the majority and you would check the box for 5 beside Expected Minimum Length.</p>

<h2 class="articleSubHeading">Why Are There Two Lines?</h2>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">A closer examination shows that there are two lines for the expected minimum length. One is for opening bids in first and second position (1st/2nd) and one is for opening bids in third and fourth position (3rd/4th). Consider this hand.</p>
<div class="singleHand">
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbol">&spades;</div>
      <div>AKQ4</div>

   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbolRed">&hearts;</div>
      <div>K5</div>

   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbol">&clubs;</div>
      <div>9743</div>
   </div>
</div>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Playing standard fiv-ecard majors, this hand would universally be opened 1&clubs;  in first or second position because there is no five-card major. Since partner is unlimited, you may be headed for game or slam and want to be sure to find the best trump suit.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">If partner passes and you have an opportunity to open in third or fourth chair with a minimum hand, there are tactical considerations. Since partner has fewer than 13 points, your prospects for game . . . and definitely slam . . . are much less. Your side might not even win the auction. If you do end up defending with partner on lead, you’d much prefer that partner lead a spade than a club. Also, an opening bid of 1&spades;  will make it more difficult for the opponents to enter the auction than an opening bid of 1&clubs; . So, opening a strong four-card major in third or fourth position has a lot going for it.</p>

<h2 class="articleSubHeading">Limit Raises?</h2>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Suppose partner opens 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span>in first or second position. What would you respond with this hand?</p>
<div class="singleHand">
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbol">&spades;</div>
      <div>A84</div>
   </div>
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbolRed">&hearts;</div>
      <div>Q<span class="tens">1</span>084</div>

   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbolRed">&diams;</div>

   </div>
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbol">&clubs;</div>
      <div>763</div>
   </div>
</div>
<p class="customParagraphStyle"> If the answer is 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span>, showing support and an invitational hand of about 10-12 points, you are playing limit raises. You would check the box for Inv. (invitational) beside Double Raise under Responses.</p>
<img src="https://devbbcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/oneNTRange.png">
<p class="customParagraphStyle">This is the standard use of the double raise of opener’s suit. Note that you don’t need to indicate that a single raise to the two level shows about 6-9/10 points . . . or that you count dummy points for shortness when considering how strong a response to make.</p>

<h2 class="articleSubHeading">What If There Is an Overcall?</h2>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">What if you hold the same hand opposite partner’s 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span> opening bid but the opponent on your left makes an overcall of 1&spades; ?</p>
<div class="singleHand">
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbol">&spades;</div>
      <div>A84</div>
   </div>
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbolRed">&hearts;</div>
      <div>Q<span class="tens">1</span>084</div>
   </div>
   <div class="singleSuit">
      <div class="suitSymbolRed">&diams;</div>

      <div class="suitSymbol">&clubs;</div>
      <div>763</div>
   </div>
</div>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">If you would still jump to 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span> to show an invitational hand, you would check the Invitational box beside After Overcall:</p>
<img src="https://devbbcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/oneNTRange.png">
<p class="customParagraphStyle">The modern style is toward treating a jump raise as preemptive (weak) after an overcall. Why? The opponent’s overcall has made two new bids available: a double and a cuebid. Most partnerships use the double as takeout (negative) but the cuebid can be used to show a limit raise or better in opener’s suit. So, with the above hand, you would cuebid 2&spades; rather than jumping to 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span>. That frees up the 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span> jump response to be a weak bid in competitive auctions, designed to make it difficult for the opponents to find their best spot.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Whether your partnership treats the jump raise as invitational, strong (forcing to game), or weak, just check the appropriate box. Notice than any of these styles are considered  standard. You don’t have to alert the opponents. It’s up to them . . . or you if the shoe is on the other foot . . . to look at the convention card or ask if they want to know what your jump raise shows.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Lorem</p>
<h2 class="articleSubHeading">The Forcing Raise?</h2>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Now suppose you hold this hand and partner opens 1<span class="red">&hearts;</span>.</p>
<img src="https://devbbcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/oneNTRange.png">
<p class="customParagraphStyle">With 11 high-card points plus 3 dummy points for the singleton club, you have enough to commit the partnership to game.</p>
<p class="customParagraphStyle">Since a jump raise to 3<span class="red">&hearts;</span> would only be invitational of you use limit raises, most partnerships use some conventional method to describe a forcing (game-going) raise. The most popular method is Jacoby 2NT. A 2NT response to a major suit is artificial, showing four-card or longer support and a hand worth 13 or more points. Opener then has ways to show a minimum hand or extra distribution or strength. If that’s your style, check the box for 2NT beside Conv(entional) Raise.</p>
